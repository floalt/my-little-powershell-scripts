<#
this scripts add login credentials in local store

You have to do this:
 - make a GPO that maps the desired network drive
 - Add to this GPO the option to set a RUN-Value in registry
   (only if $env:APPDATA\atriumcreds doesnt exists)
   This RUN-Value will start this script

And so it is running
 1. The RUN-Value starts this script on Logon
 2. The file $env:APPDATA\atriumcreds is created
 3. THE RUN-Value will be deleted
 4. On next User Logon, the GPO mapping the network drive will be working
